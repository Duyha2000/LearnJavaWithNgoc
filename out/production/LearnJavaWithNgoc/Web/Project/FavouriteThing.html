      <h2 class="highlight">Some features about my smartphone</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Incredible Performance: The A17 Pro chip inside the iPhone 15 Pro Max
          delivers next-level speed and efficiency. Whether I’m multitasking
          with several apps, editing photos, or gaming, the phone never lags. It
          handles everything smoothly and effortlessly, which is exactly what I
          need from a device I use daily for work, entertainment, and everything
          in between.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stunning Display: The 6.7-inch OLED display is one of the best I’ve
          ever used. The colors are rich and accurate, and the brightness is
          more than sufficient even in direct sunlight. Watching movies,
          scrolling through photos, or even just reading text on this screen is
          an absolute joy. The 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel fluid
          and responsive, from swiping between apps to playing action-packed
          games.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photography Excellence: The iPhone 15 Pro Max has one of the best
          mobile camera systems on the market, and as someone who loves
          photography, this is a huge plus. The 48MP main camera captures
          incredible detail, and the new telephoto lens is perfect for zooming
          in on far-off subjects without sacrificing quality. Whether I’m
          shooting portraits, landscapes, or low-light scenes, the camera
          produces sharp, vibrant, and natural-looking photos. The new action
          mode also makes recording smooth, cinematic video a breeze.
        </li>
        <li>
          Battery Life: The battery life on the iPhone 15 Pro Max is impressive.
          Even with heavy use, I can easily make it through an entire day on a
          single charge. And with faster charging thanks to USB-C, I don’t have
          to worry about spending too much time plugged in. The efficient A17
          Pro chip, paired with software optimizations, ensures that the phone
          can last longer without draining the battery.
        </li>
        <li>
          Longevity and Support: Apple is known for providing excellent software
          support, and with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, I know it’s going to receive
          iOS updates for many years. This longevity makes it a reliable
          investment, and I appreciate knowing that my phone will stay up to
          date with the latest features and security patches for several years
          to come.
