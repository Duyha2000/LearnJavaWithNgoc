# Programming Exercises

## Exercise 1:

Write a program to check if an integer n entered from the keyboard is even or odd. If it is even, print "Even number". If it is odd, print "Odd number". For example:

Given n = 10, the output should be: "Even number".
Given n = 151, the output should be: "Odd number".

Note: Use either a regular if/else statement or the ternary operator: condition ? true : false.

## Exercise 2

Write a code snippet that accepts the salaries of two people. Your task is to find out who has the higher salary. Output: If the first person has the higher salary, the program should print "person1" on the command line. If the second person has the higher salary, the program should print "person2".

Note: Use either a regular if/else statement or the ternary operator: condition ? true : false.

## Exercise 3

Write a code snippet that accepts a character input. Your task is to determine whether the given character is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or a non-letter character.

Initialize a variable named character.
--
Output: If the character is an uppercase letter, your program should print "upper-case alphabet". If it is a lowercase letter, print "lower-case alphabet". If it is not a letter, print "not an alphabet".


## Exercise 5

Write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year or not. If the entered year is a leap year, print: "Year year is a leap year!" If it is not a leap year, print: "Year year is not a leap year!"

A leap year is defined as a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or divisible by 400.
Example: For year = 2000, it should print: "Year 2000 is a leap year!" Conversely, for year = 1999, it should print: "Year 1999 is not a leap year!"

## Exercise 6

Given a number from 0 to 6, write a program to print the corresponding day of the week.

number: 0 => "Day of the week: Sunday"
number: 1 => "Day of the week: Monday"
number: 2 => "Day of the week: Tuesday"
number: 3 => "Day of the week: Wednesday"
number: 4 => "Day of the week: Thursday"
number: 5 => "Day of the week: Friday"
number: 6 => "Day of the week: Saturday"
Example: For number = 0, print: "Sunday". For number = 4, print: "Thursday". For number = 6, print: "Saturday".

Hint: Use a switch case statement.

## Exercise 7

- Given two integer variables a and b, and a character variable c entered from the keyboard. 
- The variable c is one of the four characters: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
-  Write a program to display the value of the expression when applying the operation c on a and b.

- For example, if you enter a = 7, c = '+', b = 9, the output should be: 16.
-> Hint: Use a switch case statement.
